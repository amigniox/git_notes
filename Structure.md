# Structure of a Repository

In Git a project is a directory and the files it contains.  Git helps
you track the history of a project over time by allowing you to record
snapshots of it over time.  A snapshot in Git terminology is a commit
and consists of

* tree - the directory and its files at that time
* parents - the commits (versions/snapshots of the project) the commit
            comes from
* message - the author and their description of the commit
